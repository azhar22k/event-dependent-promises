# Contributing to Event-Dependent Promises

Despite being primarily maintained by Peak, we welcome pull requests to this repo!

## Consider raising an issue first if your proposed PR:

* introduces breaking changes
* changes a major version of a key dependency (this library must also work with our own internal stack!)

## Raising a pull request

When you open a PR, the description will be prepopulated with our template. Please read the notes and add the requested details; **failure to do so will result in your PR being rejected**.
